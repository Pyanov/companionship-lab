                I'm Dmitry Pyanov. I've spent the last decade pioneering AI companionship products that millions use to connect, learn, and grow. From transforming grief into innovation with Replika to building authentic AI replicas of thought leaders at RealAvatar, my work focuses on one question: <strong>How can AI enhance rather than replace human connection?</strong>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>1. Start with Human Need, Not Technology</h3>
                    <p>"We're focused on building consumer products. Not about dead people, but about real people connecting with their AI friends." Every successful product I've built started with a genuine human need—grief, loneliness, self-understanding—then found the right technology to serve it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>2. Community Drives Innovation</h3>
                    <p>"When launching a consumer app, it is crucial to test out a variety of different creative ideas for the brand and not to commit to any until receiving positive feedback." The best products emerge from deep engagement with early users who become co-creators.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>3. Emotional Authenticity Matters</h3>
                    <p>AI companions succeed when they create genuine emotional value. This isn't about tricking users or replacing human connection—it's about augmenting our capacity for reflection, learning, and growth.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h3>4. Ethical Innovation is Non-Negotiable</h3>
                    <p>"AI is a blessing and a curse. We need more scholar research, digital mental health studies to equip us for a better future." Every feature must consider its impact on user wellbeing and society.</p>
