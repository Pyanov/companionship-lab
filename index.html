                    I'm Dmitry Pyanov. Over the past decade, I've pioneered AI companionship products that millions use to connect, learn, and grow. From transforming grief into innovation with Replika to building authentic AI replicas of thought leaders at RealAvatar, my work explores a singular question: <em>How can AI enhance rather than replace human connection?</em>

                        <p>"We're focused on building consumer products. Not about dead people, but about real people connecting with their AI friends." Every successful product I've built started with a genuine human need—grief, loneliness, self-understanding—then found the right technology to serve it.</p>
